# Python Commons

This repo contains a collection of reusable Bash functions for handling common tasks such as logging, assertions,
string manipulation, and more. It is our attempt to bring a little more sanity, predictability, and coding reuse to our
Python scripts. All the code has thorough automated tests and is packaged into functions, so you can safely import it
into your bash scripts using `source`.
